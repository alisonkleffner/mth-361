## What is R?

+ An open-source, free software environment
+ System for statistical computation and graphics
+ CRAN is R's central software repository
  - Contains contributed packages

It is OK if you never use it (or even heard about it) before! There is no prerequisite for this course.

## Installing R

1. Download and run the R installer for your operating system from CRAN
  - Windows: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/
  - Mac: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/
  - Linux: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/
2. Now download RStudio from the RStudio website – IDE of R
 - https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
3. If you are using a Mac, you may need to download XQuartz.
https://www.xquartz.org/
 - If you run into issues, try downloading this to see if it helps.


Go with all default options

## R Studio Set-Up

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("../images/Week1/rstudio.png")

```

To Create a Script, Click the Following: File -> New File -> R script

[R Studio IDE Cheatsheet](cheatsheets/rstudio-ide.pdf)

---

## Installing Packages

**Note**: To run code from your script:
+ Windows: Ctrl + Enter
+ Mac: Cmd + Enter
+ Highlight what you want to run and hit the “Run” button

We will be installing the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package.

**Method 1**
```{r, eval= FALSE}

install.packages("tidyverse")

#Note: It may take a while (use "#" to create notes in R)
```

**Method 2** - Point and Click

+ Tools -> Install Packages

Only have to do this once!!

---
## Load Package

Let's load the package we just installed!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Will have to run this every time we are in a new session and want to use this package

---

## Load Data

We usually work with .csv file in R. When you have a file that need to be read into the Rstudio, first put it with the R markdown file, or set the working directory to the file. 

First Check your working directory!

Method 1:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
getwd() #What is your working directory
setwd() # Change Working directory

```

Method 2 (recommendation):

Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory -> Select folder data set is located -> Apply

---
## Load Data

Second, then load in the data
```{r, linewidth=80}
data = read.csv("data/ICUAdmissions.csv")
head(data) #make sure data loads in correctly

```

Should see data in environment panel (upper right)

---

## Help


```{r eval = FALSE}
?head
```

This returns the help documentation for this function

---

## Some Basic Functions

Check variable types

```{r}
str(data)
#Note: The purpose of checking variable types is to make sure R is understanding what each column is representing.

```

---

## Some Basic Functions

ID and Race is being read as an "int" type variable, meaning as an integer.

We actually want to treat this variable as a factor!

```{r}

#To change this column to a factor:
data$ID <- as.factor(data$ID)
data$Race <- as.factor(data$Race)


#Now they are factors!
class(data$ID)
class(data$Race)

```

---

## Some Basic Functions

Selecting Specific Row/Column

```{r}
data[1,] #first row
data[1:10,3] #thrid column observations 1 - 10 (also data$Age[1:10])

data[1,3] #first observation in third column

```



---

## Some Basic Functions

If we want a summary of the data

```{r}
summary(data[1:5])
```


---

## Giant Calculator!

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 3
c <- 6

```

.pull-left[
```{r}
a+b #Addition
c-a #Subtraction
b*c #Multiplication
```
].pull-right[
```{r}
c/b #Division 
sqrt(4)
2^3
```
]

---

## Giant Calculator!

**Note**: In R, the following will not work!
```{r eval = FALSE}

b(a+c)
```
*R* will assume the "b()" is indicating some function, NOT multiplication as we do in math and stats. 

Thus, you MUST include the multiplication symbol.
```{r}
b*(a+c)
```

---

## Some Notes

+ Google is your Friend!
  - As an open source software, there is a TON of help out there!

+ If you see a red *warning*, it does not always mean something is wrong, R is just alerting you to check something

+ If you see a red *error*, code needs to be fixed to run

+ Learning to code can be challenging, so try not to get frustrated!

## Next: Brief Introduction to R Markdown

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

One method for completing labs/homework

Helpul Links:
+ [Cheatsheet](cheatsheets/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
+ [Installation Help](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html)

```{r eval = FALSE}
#This alone creates html/word documents
install.packages("rmarkdown") #install the knitr package

```


```{r eval= FALSE}
#If you want to create a PDF need Latex
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX
```

Create a new document:
+ File -> New File -> R Markdown
