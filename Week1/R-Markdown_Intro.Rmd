## R Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

R has some pre-installed data and some packages also have data included. These data sets don't need to be read from a local file, just load the package and it will be there. 

```{r}
data(cars)
glimpse(cars)
cars[1,]
cars[,1]
cars$speed
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Code Chunk Options

+ eval=FALSE: don't run the code

+ echo=FALSE: don't show the code

+ warning=FALSE: don't add R's warnings to the pdf

+ message=FALSE: don't show messages from R in the pdf

+ include=FALSE: don't include any R output in the document.

+ tidy=FALSE: don't tidy code of change spacing

+ cache=FALSE: re-run all of the code every time.
