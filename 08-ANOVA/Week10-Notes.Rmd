### ANOVA
#### April 1, 2025

---
### Announcements

- **Lab 6** on Thursday April 3 (due Friday April 4 at 11:59)
- **Homework 6**
  - Due Thursday April 10 at 11:59pm in Blueline

### Statistical Modeling

- Much of statistics involves modeling
- Generally, it is a mathematical formula showing the relationship between the response and explanatory variable(s)
- Often written as $$\text{Y = Model + Error}$$ where the model is where you put your explanatory variables

---
### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

- Used to find if the means between multiple independent groups of data are statistically significant.
- Analyzes the variance (spread) of individuals within each group as well as between the different groups


<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../08-ANOVA/images/anova-pic.png")
```



---
### Example of ANOVA

Suppose we are interested in comparing if waiting times at Starbucks differ on different days of the week.
- Explanatory:

<br>

- Number of levels:

<br>

- Response:

<br>


Typical overarching research questions: Are there at least two population means that differ?

---

### ANOVA

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests the null hypothesis that all $k$ groups have the same population mean

$$H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = .... = \mu_k$$
$$H_A : \text{not } H_0$$

The alternative hypothesis is that there’s at least two population means differ (i.e. $\mu_i \neq \mu_j$ for some i, j), 

---
### One-Way ANOVA Model

The statistical model for analysis of variance is $$Y_{i,j} = \mu + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{ij}$$

- Response variable for subject $j$ in group $i$: $Y_{i,j}$
- Grand mean: $\mu$
  + Overall mean for baseline group that all other groups are compared to
- Group effect for group $i$: $\alpha_i$ 
  + How much that group mean deviates from the intercept
- Error term for subject $j$ in group $i$: $\epsilon_{ij}$

---

### Example: Analysis of variance

Overall Summary Statistics - regardless of group

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(361)
group <- c(rep('A', 4), rep('B', 4), rep('C', 4))
y <- c(sample(5:10, 4), sample(8:15, 4), sample(12:20, 4))

data <- tibble(obs=1:12, group, y)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
favstats(~y, data=data)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=8, warning = FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=obs, y=y)) + geom_point(aes(col=group), size = 3) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=12.25, col='red')
```

---

###Example: Analysis of variance

```{r, echo=FALSE}
favstats(~y|group, data=data)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.height=6, fig.width=8, warning = FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=obs, y=y)) + geom_point(aes(col=group), size = 4) +  
  geom_hline(yintercept=12.25) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=1, y=7.5, xend=4, yend=7.5), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=5, y=12, xend=8, yend=12), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=9, y=17.25, xend=12, yend=17.25), col='red') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=2.5, y=7.5, xend=2.5, yend=12.25), col='red') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=6.5, y=12, xend=6.5, yend=12.25), col='red') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=10.5, y=17.25, xend=10.5, yend=12.25), col='red')

```

###Example: Analysis of variance

**Ask ourselves**: Does splitting our data up into groups explain the variability?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.height=5.5, fig.width=8, warning = FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=obs, y=y)) + geom_point(aes(col=group), size = 4) +  
  geom_hline(yintercept=12.25) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=1, y=7.5, xend=4, yend=7.5), col='black') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=5, y=12, xend=8, yend=12), col='black') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=9, y=17.25, xend=12, yend=17.25), col='black') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=2.5, y=7.5, xend=2.5, yend=12.25), col='black') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=6.5, y=12, xend=6.5, yend=12.25), col='black') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=10.5, y=17.25, xend=10.5, yend=12.25), col='black') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=1, y=7.5, xend=1, yend=8), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=2, y=7.5, xend=2, yend=7), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=3, y=7.5, xend=3, yend=10), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=4, y=7.5, xend=4, yend=5), col='red') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=5, y=12, xend=5, yend=14), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=6, y=12, xend=6, yend=15), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=7, y=12, xend=7, yend=10), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=8, y=12, xend=8, yend=9), col='red') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=9, y=17.25, xend=9, yend=20), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=10, y=17.25, xend=10, yend=18), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=11, y=17.25, xend=11, yend=17), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=12, y=17.25, xend=12, yend=14), col='red') 

```

### Assumptions of ANOVA

It is important to check whether the assumptions for conducting ANOVA are reasonably satisfied:

- Observations independent within and across groups
- Data within each group are nearly normal
- Variability across groups is about equal
  + Look at the data graphically
  + Numerical rule of thumb: ratio of largest sd to smallest sd < 3 is considered “about equal”
  
---
### ANOVA: Sums of Squares

Does splitting our data up into groups explain the variability?

$$\sum_{ij}(y_{ij} - \bar{y})^2 = n\sum_i(\bar{y_i} - \bar{y})^2 + \sum_{ij}(y_{ij} - \bar{y_i})^2$$

$$SS_{\text{total}} = SS_{\text{group}} + SS_{\text{error}}$$

Sums of Squares measures deviation of points from mean values
- $SS_{\text{group}}$: between group variability 
-  $SS_{\text{error}}$: variability within group 
- $SS_{\text{total}}$: variability of each observation and overall mean

---
### ANOVA: Test Statistic

The test statistic for an analysis of variance is an F-Statistic:
$$F=\frac{\text{variance between groups}}{\text{variance within groups}} = \frac{MS_{Group}}{MS_{Error}}$$

$MS_{Group}$: measure of variability between levels of each factor 

$MS_{Error}$: measure of variability within each level (error term)


---

## ANOVA Table

Software programs will report the results of an ANOVA model in an __ANOVA table__.

- The basic outline of the ANOVA table looks like this:

Source|df|Sums of Sq.|Mean Sq.|F-ratio|p-value
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Groups (trt)|k-1|SSGroup|MSGroup|F|p-value
Error|n-k|SSError|MSError||
Total|n-1|SSTotal|||

- Calculation details are in  _OpenIntro Statistics_ (p. 264-270).

### Example: Recall Football Example

A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) included three groups, with 25 subjects in each. The control group consisted of healthy individuals with no history of brain trauma who were comparable to the other groups in age, sex, and education. The second group consisted of NCAA Division 1 college football players with no history of concussion, while the third group consisted of NCAA Division 1 college football players with a history of concussion. High resolution MRI was used to collect brain hippocampus volume.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df2 <- data.frame(group = c("Control", "FBConcuss", "FBNoConcuss"), min = c(6175, 4490, 4810), Q1 = c(6780, 5505, 5965), median = c(7385, 5710, 6515), Q3 = c(8510, 6035, 7020), max = c(9710, 7160, 7790), mean = c(7602.6, 5734.6, 6459.2), sd = c(1074.02, 593.4, 779.74))

kableExtra::kable(df2)

```


Write the hypothesis for the ANOVA Test if we want to test whether the three groups have the same brain hippocampus volume. 

---

---
### Football Example: Box-plots

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
library(Lock5Data)
data(FootballBrain)

ggplot(FootballBrain, aes(x = Group, y = Hipp, fill = Group)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

```

---
### Football Example: Check Assumptions

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
ggplot(FootballBrain, aes(sample = Hipp, col = Group)) +
  stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() +
  facet_wrap(~Group)
```


Several things you can do:

- Collect more data 
- Do a log transformation

---
### Football Example: Result

Let’s assume that the data fits the assumption and here is the ANOVA table from R:

```{r}
model = aov(Hipp~Group, data = FootballBrain)
summary(model)
```

Write the conclusion for the test, for $\alpha$ = 0.05.

---
### Multiple Group Testing

You probably have realized one problem from the ANOVA test: 

- ANOVA can only tell us that at least one group is different but it won’t tell you which.

As one of the solution to the problem, you can do multiple two-sample t-test to address the difference between each pair. However...

---
### Recall the meaning of $\alpha$

In the hypothesis test, we define the significance level $\alpha$, which is also the probability of Type 1 error.

- So if we did multiple independent t-tests, we want each test to have P(Type 1 Error) = $\alpha$
  + This is called the comparison-wise error rate

Suppose we need to do three hypothesis tests on a dataset. Each one has a Type 1 error rate  $\alpha$ = 0.05. What is the probability that at least one test results is an error?



---
### Multiplicity Adjustments 

A multiplicity adjustment needs to be done to ensure that the experiment-wise Type 1 error rate stays at the specified $\alpha$ level.

Multiple types of adjustments, but we are going to focus on Tukey's HSD 
  - adjusts critical values $(t^∗)$ to control the overall error rate.

We are not going to cover the details of the methods but you need to know when to use the test and how to interpret the result table:

```{r}
TukeyHSD(model)
```

---
### Football Example: Multiplicity Adjustments

---
### Example: Yield

Experiment design is extensively applied in the field of Agriculture. People usually select several similar fields but apply different conditions, like humidity or fertilizer to each of them and compare yields (as measured by dried weight of plants) after a period of time. Following are the results of yields obtained under a control and two different treatment conditions.


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(BSDA)

data("PlantGrowth")
favstats(~weight|group, data=PlantGrowth)
```

Write the hypothesis if you want to test whether the three groups share the same population mean on yields. What data visualizations you need to check before you fit a model?

---
### Example: Yield

Here is the result for ANOVA test. Write the conclusions for each of them with $\alpha$ = 0.05. Do we need to go further?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
model = aov(weight~group, data = PlantGrowth)
summary(model)

```

---
### Example: Yield

What groups are different?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
TukeyHSD(model)
```
