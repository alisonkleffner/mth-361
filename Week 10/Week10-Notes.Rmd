### Announcements

- **Homework 7 ** due Tuesday October 31 at 11:59 pm
- **Lab 8 ** on Thursday
  + Due Friday October 27 at 11:59 pm


---
### Summary: What do you need to know for the t-test?

- **Step 1**: Identify the type of test (one-sample, paired, two-sample)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/Week10/all-t-test.png")
```


---
### Summary: What do you need to know for the t-test?
- **Step 2**: Write the null and alternative hypothesis for the test
  - Null Hypothesis always contains and equal sign
  - Alternative hypothesis is the one you want to show (research question). Can be greater than, less than, or two-sided.
- **Step 3**: Calculate the SE
  - Depends on the type of test
  - Use to find the test statistic
- **Step 4**: Given the p-value, make a conclusion for the test
  - P-value + decision + content explanation

---
### One More Example

A study tries to understand how different the average bone density will be for the physically active the women and non-active ones. The study tests 35 women’s bone density for each group and following are the summary statistics. The $t^*$ = 1.995 for 95% confidence interval.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df = data.frame(group = c("active", "nonactive"), min = c(155, 162), Q1 = c(207, 201), median = c(212, 206), Q3 = c(219, 213), max = c(257, 270), mean = c(211.63, 207.60), sd = c(8.73, 21.43), n = c(35, 35))

kableExtra::kable(df)

```

- Identify the type of the t-test
- Write the hypothesis for the test
- Calculate the SE of the test
- If the p-vale is 0.3084, write the conclusion of the test

---

### Statistical Modeling

- Much of statistics involves modeling
- Generally, it is a mathematicl formula showing the relationship between the response and explanatory variable(s)
- Often written as $$\text{Y = Model + Error}$$ where the model is where you put your explanatory variables

---
### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

- Used to find if the difference between multiple independent groups of data are statistically significant.
- Analyzes the variance (spread) of individuals within each group as well as between the different groups
- What matters is not how far apart the sample means are, but how far apart they are relative to the variability of individual observations.
- Also takes into account sample size and difference between the groups

### Examples of ANOVA

Suppose we are interested in comparing if waiting times at Starbucks differ on different days of the week.
- Explanatory:
- Number of levels:
- Response:


Suppose we are interested in comparing if salaries tend to increase as education level
(Associates, bachelors, master’s, doctoral) increases.
- Explanatory:
- Number of levels:
- Response:

Typical overarching research questions: Are there at least two population means that differ?

---

### ANOVA

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests the null hypothesis that all $k$ groups have the same population mean

$$H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = .... = \mu_k$$
$$H_A : \text{not } H_0$$

The alternative hypothesis is that there’s at least two population means differ (i.e. $\mu_i \neq \mu_j$ for some i, j), 

---
### One-Way ANOVA Model

The statistical model for an analysis of variance is $$Y_{i,j} = \mu + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{ij}$$

- Response variable for subject $j$ in group $i$: $Y_{i,j}$
- Mean response for each group $i$: $\mu_i = \mu + \alpha_i$
- Grand mean: $\mu$
  + Overall mean for baseline group that all other groups are compared to
- Group effect for group $i$: $\alpha_i$ 
  + How much that group mean deviates from the intercept
- Error term for subject $j$ in group $i$: $\epsilon_{ij}$

### Example: Analysis of variance

Overall Summary Statistics - regardless of group

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(361)
group <- c(rep('A', 4), rep('B', 4), rep('C', 4))
y <- c(sample(5:10, 4), sample(8:15, 4), sample(12:20, 4))

data <- tibble(obs=1:12, group, y)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
favstats(~y, data=data)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=8, warning = FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=obs, y=y)) + geom_point(aes(col=group)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=12.25, col='red')
```

---

###Example: Analysis of variance

```{r, echo=FALSE}
favstats(~y|group, data=data)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.height=6, fig.width=8, warning = FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=obs, y=y)) + geom_point(aes(col=group)) +  
  geom_hline(yintercept=12.25) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=1, y=7.5, xend=4, yend=7.5), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=5, y=12, xend=8, yend=12), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=9, y=17.25, xend=12, yend=17.25), col='red') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=2.5, y=7.5, xend=2.5, yend=12.25), col='red') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=6.5, y=12, xend=6.5, yend=12.25), col='red') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=10.5, y=17.25, xend=10.5, yend=12.25), col='red')

```

###Example: Analysis of variance

**Ask ourselves**: Does splitting our data up into groups explain the variability?
- We want to show the variation between groups is larger than the variation within the groups.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.height=5.5, fig.width=8, warning = FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=obs, y=y)) + geom_point(aes(col=group)) +  
  geom_hline(yintercept=12.25) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=1, y=7.5, xend=4, yend=7.5), col='black') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=5, y=12, xend=8, yend=12), col='black') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=9, y=17.25, xend=12, yend=17.25), col='black') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=2.5, y=7.5, xend=2.5, yend=12.25), col='black') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=6.5, y=12, xend=6.5, yend=12.25), col='black') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=10.5, y=17.25, xend=10.5, yend=12.25), col='black') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=1, y=7.5, xend=1, yend=8), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=2, y=7.5, xend=2, yend=7), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=3, y=7.5, xend=3, yend=10), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=4, y=7.5, xend=4, yend=5), col='red') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=5, y=12, xend=5, yend=14), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=6, y=12, xend=6, yend=15), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=7, y=12, xend=7, yend=10), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=8, y=12, xend=8, yend=9), col='red') +
  geom_segment(aes(x=9, y=17.25, xend=9, yend=20), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=10, y=17.25, xend=10, yend=18), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=11, y=17.25, xend=11, yend=17), col='red') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=12, y=17.25, xend=12, yend=14), col='red')

### Assumptions of ANOVA

It is important to check whether the assumptions for conducting ANOVA are reasonably satisfied:

- Observations independent within and across groups
  + Think about study design/context
- Data within each group are nearly normal
  + Look at the data graphically, such as with a histogram 
  + Normal Q-Q plots can help
- Variability across groups is about equal
  + Look at the data graphically
  + Numerical rule of thumb: ratio of largest variance to smallest variance < 3 is considered “about equal”
  
---
### ANOVA: Sums of Squares

Does splitting our data up intro groups explain the variability?

$$\sum_{ij}(y_{ij} - \bar{y})^2 = n\sum_i(\bar{y_i} - \bar{y})^2 + \sum_{ij}(y_{ij} - \bar{y_i})^2$$

$$SS_{\text{total}} = SS_{\text{treatment}} + SS_{\text{error}}$$

Sums of Squares measures deviation of points from mean values
- $SS_{\text{treatment}}$ signifies between group variability (how much the means vary from group to group)
  + Used to calculate the between-group variance
-  $SS_{\text{error}}$ signifies variability within group (how much the
observations vary within each group)
  - Used to calculate the within-group variance
- $SS_{\text{total}}$  signifies variability of each observation and
overall mean

---
### ANOVA: Sums of Squares

If one of the groups have a much different mean from the others, we expect $SS_{\text{treatment}}$ to be large.

We want to show the variation between groups are larger than the variation within the groups.


---
### ANOVA: Test Statistic

The test statistic for an analysis of variance is an F-Statistic:
$$F=\frac{\text{variance between groups}}{\text{variance within groups}} = \frac{MS_{Group}}{MS_{Error}}$$

$MS_{Group}$: measure of variability between levels of each factor 

$MS_{Error}$: measure of variability within each level (error term)


---

## ANOVA Table

Software programs will report the results of an ANOVA model in an __ANOVA table__.

- The basic outline of the ANOVA table looks like this:

Source|df|Sums of Sq.|Mean Sq.|F-ratio|p-value
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Groups (trt)|k-1|SSGroup|MSGroup|F|p-value
Error|n-k|SSError|MSError||
Total|n-1|SSTotal|||

- Calculation details are in  _OpenIntro Statistics_ (p. 264-270).
- I won't expect you to calculate an ANOVA table by hand, but you should be able to identify the most important parts of the ANOVA table and what they tell us.

### Example: Recall our football Example

A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) included three groups, with 25 subjects in each. The control group consisted of healthy individuals with no history of brain trauma who were comparable to the other groups in age, sex, and education. The second group consisted of NCAA Division 1 college football players with no history of concussion, while the third group consisted of NCAA Division 1 college football players with a history of concussion. High resolution MRI was used to collect brain hippocampus volume.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df2 <- data.frame(group = c("Control", "FBConcuss", "FBNoConcuss"), min = c(6175, 4490, 4810), Q1 = c(6780, 5505, 5965), median = c(7385, 5710, 6515), Q3 = c(8510, 6035, 7020), max = c(9710, 7160, 7790), mean = c(7602.6, 5734.6, 6459.2), sd = c(1074.02, 593.4, 779.74))

kableExtra::kable(df2)

```


Write the hypothesis for the ANOVA Test if we want to test whether the three group have the same brain hippocampus volume. 

---

---
### Football Example: Box-plots

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
library(Lock5Data)
data(FootballBrain)

ggplot(FootballBrain, aes(x = Group, y = Hipp, fill = Group)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

```


---
### Football Example: Check Assumptions

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
library(Lock5Data)
data(FootballBrain)

ggplot(FootballBrain, aes(x = Group, y = Hipp)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col = Group))

```



---
### Football Example: Check Assumptions

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
ggplot(FootballBrain, aes(sample = Hipp, col = Group)) +
  stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() +
  facet_wrap(~Group)
```


Several things you can do:

- Collect more data 
- Do a log transformation

---
### Football Example: Result

Let’s assume that the data fits the assumption and here is the ANOVA table from R:

```{r}
model = aov(Hipp~Group, data = FootballBrain)
summary(model)
```

Write the conclusion for the test, for $\alpha$ = 0.05.

---
### Multiple Group Testing

You probably have realized one problem from the ANOVA test.

--
ANOVA can only tell us that at least one group is different but it won’t tell you which.

As one of the solution to the problem, you can do multiple two-sample t-test to address the difference between each pair. However...

---
### Recall the meaning of $\alpha$

In the hypothesis test, we define the significant level $\alpha$, which is also the probability of Type 1 error.

- So if we did multiple independent t-tests, we want each test to have P(Type 1 Error) = $\alpha$
  + This is called the comparison-wise error rate

Suppose we need to do three hypothesis tests on a dataset. Each one has a Type 1 error rate  $\alpha$ = 0.05. What is the probability that at least one test results is an error?

--

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

This increases the Type 1 error to about 0.143 for the whole experiment.
  - Called the "family-wise" or "experiment-wise" error rate
  
---
### Multiplicity Adjustments 

A multiplicity adjustment needs to be done to ensure that the experiment-wise Type 1 error rate stays at the specified $\alpha$ level.

Multiple types of adjustments, but we are going to focus on Tukey's HSD 
  - adjusts critical values $(t^∗)$ to control the overall error rate.

We are not going to cover the details of the methods but you need to know when to use the test and how to interpret the result table:

```{r}
TukeyHSD(model)
```

---
### Example: Yield

Experiment design is extensively applied in the field of Agriculture. People usually select several similar fields but apply different conditions, like humidity or fertilizer to each of them and compare yields (as measured by dried weight of plants) after a period of time. Following are the results of yields obtained under a control and two different treatment conditions.


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(BSDA)

data("PlantGrowth")
favstats(~weight|group, data=PlantGrowth)
```

Write the hypothesis if you want to test whether the three groups share the same population mean on yields. What data visualizations you need to check before you fit a model?

---
### Example: Yield

Here is the result for ANOVA test. Write the conclusions for each of them with $\alpha$ = 0.05. Do we need to go further?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
model = aov(weight~group, data = PlantGrowth)
summary(model)

```

--
<br>

What groups are different?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
TukeyHSD(model)
```
