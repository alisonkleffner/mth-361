### Lab 1 Notes

- Show your work

- **Confounding Variables**: unmeasured third variable that influences both the explanatory and response variables.
  - If unaccounted for, may introduce bias

- **Observational studies** -> confounding variables -> no cause and effect

- **Experimental studies** -> balance out confounding variables (randomization) -> can determine cause and effect
    + [Example](https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/randomassignment/Subjects.html)
---
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

After describing the data, we also need to summarize and view the data's main characteristics.

Why?

- Further understand the data and variables
- Check missing values and potential outliers
- Help us to decide later modeling choices

How?
- Summary statistics
- Data visualization

---
### A Quick Note on Good Graphics

Visualization is a method to communicate patterns in data to a wider audience. To do this effectively, the visualizations must be clear, honest, and efficient.

A Few Principles:

- Show the data
- Make patterns in the data easy to see
- Represent magnitudes honestly
- Make graphical elements clear


---
### Case Study: ICU Admission Data

Data for a sample of 200 patients at an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The data set contains 20 variables. Here is a list of the ones we will use in this example:

- Age
- Race
- Heart Rate
- Systolic
- Cancer: Yes/No
- Type: Elective/Emergency

### EDA for One Continuous Variable

- Measures of Center
  - Mean
  - Median
- Variability and Spread
  - Standard Deviation
  - Variance
  - Range and IQR
- Visualization
  - Box-plot
  - Histograms and Density Plots

---
### Measurse of Center

Sample Mean: average of all individuals in a sample
$$ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}x_i}{n} $$
Same median (*m*): middle observation when all the values are ordered from smallest to largest.

**Example**: We have a mean age of 57.5 and a median age of 63.

--

<br>
<br>
.center[**How to interpret them?**]
<br>
<br>

--

The average age of people in the study in 57.5. Half of the age's of the people in the study is below (or above) 63 years old. 

---
### Standard Deviation and Variance

**Sample Standard Deviation (s)**: a measure of spread in a data set, the "typical" distance between an individual observation and the sample mean.

$$s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum^{n}_{i-1}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$
**Thus a typical range of data is between ** $\bar{x} \pm s$

- "Large" *s* indicates that the observations are typically far from the mean
- "Small" *s* indicates that observations are closely concentrated around the mean
- The "large" and "small" are relatively speaking

**Variance**: $s^2$
  
  - Variance has some nice mathematical properties, but it is less useful for interpreting data. Variance is useful in probability theory!
  
---
### Outliers

**Outliers** are unusual data points in the data set

A summary statistic is called **resistant** if its value does not change much when outliers are included

  - The median is a resistant summary statistic, whereas the mean and standard deviation are not

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%"}

```

]

---
### Range and IQR

Another way to describe the Variability:

  - Range: the interval between the minimum value and maximum value
  - Interquartile Range (IQR): the difference between the $75^{th}$ (Q3) and $25^{th}$ (Q1) percentiles
  
The definition of IQR is related to a boxplot and one of the way to define outliers.

---
### Visualizing the Distribution

Use a histogram to capture the distribution (pattern of outcomes) of a variable

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("../Week 3/data/ICUAdmissions.csv")


library(tidyverse)

#Histograms to Capture the Distribution
data %>% ggplot(aes(Age)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle("Histogram of Age with 30 Bins")
```
].pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

data %>% ggplot(aes(Age)) + geom_histogram(bins = 15) + ggtitle("Histogram of Age with 15 Bins")
```

]

**Note**: Choose interval carefully as it may impact conclusions
  
---
### Visualizing the Distribution

Another option for the distribution of a continuous variable: density plot

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

data %>% ggplot(aes(Age)) + geom_density() + ggtitle("Density Plot of Age")
```
].pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

data %>% ggplot(aes(Age)) + geom_density(color="darkblue", fill="lightblue") + ggtitle("Density Plot of Age")
```

]
  

---
### Describing the Distribution


Describing a Distribution:
  - Shape: symmetric/skewed?, mound-shaped (unimodal?, bimodal?)
  - Center: where does the center of the pattern appear? 
  - Variability: how spread out is the distribution?
  - Unusual data: Outliers?
  
  
---
### Describing the Distribution

**Skewness**: a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a continuous random variable about it's mean.

.center[


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%"}

knitr::include_graphics("../Week 3/images/skewness.png")

```

### Exercise
.center[Let's explore the Heart Rate variable with the given summary statistics and figure
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
j <- t(data.frame(c(summary(data$HeartRate), sd= sd(data$HeartRate), n= length(data$HeartRate), missing=sum(is.na(data$HeartRate)))))
rownames(j) <- NULL 

kableExtra::kable(j)

```
].pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(HeartRate)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle("Histogram of Heart Rate")
```
]

--
.pull-right[
- 200 observations without any missing values
- The average heart rate is about 98.9 and half of the people have a heart rate over 96.
- The range of the data is from 39-192, while a typical value would fall between 72.1 and 125.8
- The distribution of the variable is unimodal and almost symmetrical (slightly skewed right)
- There may be a potential outlier

### EDA for One Categorical Variable

- Frequency Table
- Sample Proportion $(\hat{p})$: the proportion in a given category of interest

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(Race = factor(Race, 
                    levels = c("1", "2", "3"),
                    labels = c("White", "Black", "Other")))

dt <- data %>%    
  group_by(Race) %>%    
  summarise(count = n()) %>% mutate(prop = count/sum(count))


kableExtra::kable(dt)

```

---
### EDA for One Categorical Variable

Visualization: Bar Charts

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=Race, fill = Race)) + geom_bar()
```

--

Making a Good Bar Chart:

- Baseline of the y-axis should be at 0.
- For ordinal variables, the bars should be in the natural order. For nominal variables, best to arrange by frequency of occurrence. 
---
### Difference Between Bar-Plot and Histogram

- Histograms are for continuous variables; Bar plots are for categorical variables
- Histograms are for describing distributions; Bar plot are for bar-to-bar comparison
- You can not switch the order of the histogram, but for most cases, it is OK to switch the bar order on a Bar Plot


.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=Race)) + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Bar Plot of Race Distribution")

### EDA for Two Contiuous Variables

- Pearson Correlation Coefficient $(r)$: a measure of linear correlation between two sets of data (more in later chapters)
- Scatterplots

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}

data %>% ggplot(aes(x=Systolic, y = HeartRate)) + geom_point()

```

### Focus on Trend

If you want to focus on the trend of the data (the change in $y$-value with the increase of $x$-value):

- Line Plots
- Smooth Line Plots

Especially useful if want to show data over time

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=Systolic, y = HeartRate)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Line Plot")
```
].pull-right[

data$Infection <- as.factor(data$Infection)
data %>% ggplot(aes(y = HeartRate, fill = Infection)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Box Plot of Heart Rate")

### Exercise

A Medical Insurance Company data for almost 1000 customers, where the data is voluntarily given by customers.

.pull-left[
- Age
- Diabetes
- BloodPressureProblems
- AnyTransplants
- AnyChronicDiseases
- Height
].pull-right[
- Weight
- KnownAllergies
- HistoryOfCancerInFamily
- NumberofMajorSurgeries
- PremiumPrice
] 

For each of the following scenarios, which summary statistics and data visualization should you use?

(a). If you want to examine whether there is a relationship between Age and Premium Price (consider both as continuous variables) $\\$
(b). If you want to learn more information about people with a transplant. $\\$
(c) If you want to know the relation between whether someone has a transplant and the premium price. $\\$
(d) If you want to know whether having a transplant will related to whether people having any chronic diseases.

---
### Exercise (a)

(a). If you want to examine whether there is a relationship between Age and Premium Price (consider both as continuous variables), which summary statistics and data visualizations should you use?

--

The Correlation Coefficient is 0.698

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}

med <- read.csv("../Week 3/data/Medicalpremium.csv")

med %>% ggplot(aes(x=Age, y = PremiumPrice)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Scatterplot of Age vs Premium Price")
  
```

--

The correlation coefficient and the scatterplot indicates that there may exist a moderate positive linear relationship between age and premium price.

---
### Exercise (b)


(b). If you want to learn more information about people with a transplant, what summary statistics and data visualization would you consider?

--

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE}
med <- med %>% 
  mutate(AnyTransplants = factor(AnyTransplants, 
                       levels = c("0", "1"),
                       labels = c("No", "Yes"))) 

kableExtra::kable(t(table(med$AnyTransplants)))

```
].pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}

med %>% ggplot(aes(x=AnyTransplants)) + geom_bar() + theme(axis.ticks.x=element_blank())

```

]

--

55/(931+55) = 5.58% of the patients have a transplant.

---
#### Exercise (c)

(c) If you want to know the relation between those with transplant & the premium price, what summary statistics and data visualization can you use?

--
```{r, echo = FALSE}
kableExtra::kable(med %>% group_by(AnyTransplants) %>% summarise(min = min(PremiumPrice), Q1=quantile(PremiumPrice, probs = 0.25),
                                               med=median(PremiumPrice), Q3=quantile(PremiumPrice, probs = 0.75), max = max(PremiumPrice), 
                                               mean = mean(PremiumPrice), sd= sd(PremiumPrice), n = n(), miss= sum(is.na(PremiumPrice))))

```

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6}
med %>% ggplot(aes(y = PremiumPrice, fill = AnyTransplants)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Box Plot of Premium Price")

```
]

--
.pull-right[

- The people without a transplant typically will get a premium price from $18156 to $29639
- The people with a transplant typically will get a premium price from $22550 to $40977
- The people with a transplant tend to have a larger variability on their premium price
- On average, the people with a transplant tend to have a higher premium price. No overlap in box plots, so the difference is significant


]

---
### Exercise (d)

(d) If you want to know whether having a transplant will related to whether people having any chronic diseases, which summary statistics and data visualization you may choose?

--

.pull-left[

```{r, echo=FALSE}
med <- med %>% 
  mutate(AnyChronicDiseases = factor(AnyChronicDiseases, 
                                 levels = c("0", "1"),
                                 labels = c("No", "Yes"))) 


tab2 <- table(med$AnyTransplants ,med$AnyChronicDiseases)
names(attributes(tab2)$dimnames) <- c("Transplant","Chronic")
tab2

```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6}
med %>% ggplot(aes(x=AnyChronicDiseases, fill = AnyTransplants))+ facet_grid(~AnyTransplants) + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Side-by-side bar plot of chronic diseases vs transplant")
```
]

--
.pull-right[

- Among the people without transplants, 165/(165+766) = 17.7% of people have chronic diseases
- Among the people with transplants, 13/(13+42) = 23.6% of people have chronic diseases
- From the data, it seems that people with transplants are more likely to have chronic diseases but the difference is not large.
