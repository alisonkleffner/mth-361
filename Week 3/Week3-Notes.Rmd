### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

After describing the data, we also need to summarize and view the data's main characteristics.

Why?

- Further understand the data and variables
- Check missing values and potential outliers
- Help us to decide later modeling choices

How?
- Summary statistics
- Data visualization

Choosing an effective data display is a much a science as an art.


---
### A Quick Note on Good Graphics

Visualization is a method to communicate patterns in data to a wider audience. To do this effectively, they must be clear, honest, and efficient.

A Few Principles:

- Show the data
- Make patterns in the data easy to see
- Represent magnitudes honestly
- Make graphical elements clear

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}

### Case Study: ICU Admission Data

Data for a sample of 200 patients at an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The data set contains 15 variables. Here is a list of the ones we will use in this example:

- Age
- Race
- Heart Rate
- Systolic
- Cancer: Yes/No
- Type: Elective/Emergency

**Let's read in the data together**

<br>

Note:

- All R code for producing the graphics and data summaries will use the `tidyverse` and `mosaic` libraries. The code can be found in the provided file in BlueLine (`Week3-Notes.R`), so you should be able to reproduce these graphics at home.


---
### Case Study: ICU Admission Data

Point and Click Methods

- *Note*: If using Posit Cloud, you have an extra step. You must upload the data file into your Posit Cloud account

.pull-left[
**Method 1**: Import Data set in Environment Tab (Works well for .csv/.xlsx files) using *Import Dataset*

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("../Week 3/images/read-data.png")

```

].pull-right[
**Method 2**: Navigate to dataset in Files Tab. Click on desired file, then `Import Dataset`

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("../Week 3/images/read-data2.png")

```

]

---
### Check Variable Types

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("../Week 3/data/ICUAdmissions.csv")
```


```{r}
str(data)
```

Note: The purpose of checking variable types is to make sure R is understanding what each column is representing.

---
### Check Variable Types

`R` does not always read in the variables correctly. For example, `Cancer` is being read in as a integer, when it is a factor (0 if have cancer, 1 if don't). We can change this!

```{r}
#To change this column to a factor:
data$Cancer<- as.factor(data$Cancer)
#Now Cancer is a Factor!
class(data$Cancer)
```

# EDA for One Continuous Variable
]

---
### EDA for One Continuous Variable: Measurse of Center

Sample Mean: average of all individuals in a sample
$$ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}x_i}{n} $$
Same median (*m*): middle observation when all the values are ordered from smallest to largest.

**Example**: We have a mean age of 57.5 and a median age of 63.


---
### EDA for One Continuous Variable: Standard Deviation and Variance

**Sample Standard Deviation (s)**: a measure of spread in a data set, the "typical" distance between an individual observation and the sample mean.

$$s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum^{n}_{i-1}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$
**Thus a typical range of data is between ** $\bar{x} \pm s$

- "Large" *s* indicates that the observations are typically far from the mean
- "Small" *s* indicates that observations are closely concentrated around the mean
- The "large" and "small" are relative

**Variance**: $s^2$
  
  - Variance has some nice mathematical properties, but it is less useful for interpreting data. Variance is useful in probability theory!
  
---
### Outliers

**Outliers** are unusual data points in the data set

A summary statistic is called **resistant** if its value does not change much when outliers are included

  - The median is a resistant summary statistic, whereas the mean and standard deviation are not
  
  
.center[


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%"}

knitr::include_graphics("../Week 3/images/mean-median.png")

```

]

---
### Range and IQR

Another way to describe the Variability:

  - Range: the interval between the minimum value and maximum value
  - Interquartile Range (IQR): the difference between the $75^{th}$ (Q3) and $25^{th}$ (Q1) percentiles
  
The definition of IQR is related to a boxplot and one of the way to define outliers.


.center[


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%"}

knitr::include_graphics("../Week 3/images/iqr-box.png")

```

]

---
### Easy Calculation of Summary Statistics
  
Use the `favstats()` function in the  `mosaic` package. 

```{r, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(mosaic)
favstats(data$Age) #gives statistical summaries
```


```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
favstats(data$Age) #gives statistical summaries
```


Can also use `summary()` but `favstats()` also provide total number of observations and number of missing values. 

---
### Visualizing the Distribution - Boxplots

We will use the `ggplot` package to create plots in `R`
- [ggplot cheat sheet](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/data-visualization-1.pdf)


```{r, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=4.5}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x = Age)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + #<<
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Age")
```

---
### Visualizing the Distribution - Histograms


Use a histogram to capture the distribution (pattern of outcomes) of a variable

.pull-left[
```{r, message=FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(Age)) + 
  geom_histogram() + #<<
  ggtitle("Histogram 30 Bins")
```
].pull-right[
```{r, message=FALSE}

data %>% ggplot(aes(Age)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 10) + #<<
  ggtitle("Histogram 10 Bins")
```

]

---
### Visualizing the Distribution - Density Plots

Another option for the distribution of a continuous variable: density plot

.pull-left[
```{r, message=FALSE}

data %>% ggplot(aes(Age)) + 
  geom_density() + #<<
  ggtitle("Density Plot of Age")
```
].pull-right[
```{r, message=FALSE}

data %>% ggplot(aes(Age)) + 
  geom_density(fill="blue") + #<<
  ggtitle("Density Plot of Age")
```

]
  

---
### Describing the Distribution


Describing a Distribution:
  - Shape: symmetric/skewed?, mound-shaped (unimodal?, bimodal?)
  - Center: where does the center of the pattern appear? 
  - Variability: how spread out is the distribution?
  - Unusual data: Outliers?
  
  
---
### Describing the Distribution

**Skewness**: a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a continuous random variable about it's mean.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}

### Exercise

Describe the Heart Rate variable using the given summary statistics and figure

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
j <- t(data.frame(c(summary(data$HeartRate), sd= sd(data$HeartRate), n= length(data$HeartRate), missing=sum(is.na(data$HeartRate)))))
rownames(j) <- NULL 

kableExtra::kable(j)

```
].pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(HeartRate)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle("Histogram of Heart Rate")

---
### EDA for One Categorical Variable

- Frequency Table (must be a factor!)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(Race = factor(Race, 
                    levels = c("1", "2", "3"),
                    labels = c("White", "Black", "Other")))

```

```{r}
table(data$Race)
```

- Sample Proportion $(\hat{p})$: the proportion in a given category of interest

```{r}

data %>%    
  group_by(Race) %>%    
  summarise(count = n()) %>% mutate(prop = count/sum(count))

```

---
### EDA for One Categorical Variable

Visualization: Bar Charts

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=5}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=Race, fill = Race)) + 
  geom_bar() #<<
```

---
### Difference Between Bar-Plot and Histogram

- Histograms are for continuous variables; Bar plots are for categorical variables
- You can not switch the order of the histogram, but for most cases, it is OK to switch the bar order on a Bar Plot


.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=Race)) + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Bar Plot of Race Distribution")
```
].pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(Age)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle("Histogram of Age Distribution")

### EDA for Two Contiuous Variables

- Numerical: Pearson Correlation Coefficient $(r)$: a measure of linear correlation between two sets of data (more in later chapters)
- Visualziation: Scatterplots

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}

data %>% ggplot(aes(x=Systolic, y = HeartRate)) + 
  geom_point() + #<<
  ggtitle("Scatterplot of Systolic vs Heart Rate")

---
### Focus on Trend

If you want to focus on the trend of the data (the change in $y$-value with the increase of $x$-value):

- Line Plots
- Smooth Line Plots

Especially useful if want to show data over time

---
### Focus on Trend - Line Plots

.pull-left[
```{r}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Systolic,
             y=HeartRate))+

```
]

---
### EDA for One Contiuous and One Categorical Variable

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.height=6}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=HeartRate, 
        fill = Infection)) + 
  facet_grid(~Infection) + #<<
  geom_density() + #<<
  ggtitle("Box Plot of HR")
