**Now introduce yourselves!** This class will involve collaboration time, so take a second to get to know the people around you.

- Names
- Find at least one thing you have in common (ideally something more exciting than a common major)

## Course Information

## What will be in this course?

- Not a ton of calculations, but a lot of interpreting, reading, and writing.
- We will work with *R* code and output. If programming is new and hard to you, focus on the statistical concepts first!
- The labs and homework, when applicable, will be provided in both *R* file and PDF.

## What is Statistics?
]

---
## What is Data?

- Data are plain facts, usually raw numbers.  Think of a spreadsheet full of numbers with no meaningful description. In order for these numbers to become information, they must be interpreted to have meaning.
- Collected on observational units.
- Can be in the form of counts, measurements, or responses.


---

## What is Statistics?

- Statistics is a branch of mathematical science that pertains to the collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.
  + But it is not Math!
- It is applicable to a wide variety of disciplines from physical science to social sciences and humanities
  + Also used in everyday life - statistical literacy
- Helps us to make educated guesses about the unknown in an ocean of data

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("./images/stat-areas.png")

```

## Branches of Statistics

.pull-left[

**Descriptive statistics** are methods that describe, show, or summarize the data from our sample in a meaningful way.
  - Tables, charts, averages
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("./images/graph-ex.png")

```
  
].pull-right[

**Inferential statistics** are methods that allow us to draw conclusions about the larger population that the sample represents.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("./images/inference.png")

```
  
]

---
## Examples in the News

.pull-left[

**Descriptive statistics**: 

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

i1 <- img_modal(src = "../Week 1/images/descriptive-example.png", alt = "Ages of 119th Congress",other=list(width="100%"))

c(str_split(i1, "\\n", simplify = T)[1:2],
  str_split(i1, "\\n", simplify = T)[3:9]
  ) %>% paste(collapse = "\n") %>% cat()

## Arson Activity

Before we look at results, let’s discuss some predictions first! With the people around you, discuss the following questions: 
+ If you are not the criminal, how many questions would you expect to get correct?
+ If you are the criminal, how many questions would you expect to get correct?

## What is R?

+ An open-source, free software environment
+ System for statistical computation and graphics
+ CRAN is *R*'s central software repository
  - Contains contributed packages
  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
