## What is Data?

- Data are plain facts, usually raw numbers.  Think of a spreadsheet full of numbers with no meaningful description. In order for these numbers to become information, they must be interpreted to have meaning.
- Collected on observational units.
- Can be in the form of counts, measurements, or responses.

## What is Statistics?

- Statistics is a branch of mathematical science that pertains to the collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.
  + But it is not Math!
- It is applicable to a wide variety of disciplines from physical science to social sciences and humanities
  + Also used in everyday life - statistical literacy
- Helps us to make educated guesses about the unknown in an ocean of data

## Branches of Statistics

.pull-left[

**Descriptive statistics** are methods that describe, show, or summarize the data from our sample in a meaningful way.
  - Tables, charts, averages
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("../images/Week1/graph-ex.png")

```
  
].pull-right[

**Inferential statistics** are methods that allow us to draw conclusions about the larger population that the sample represents.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("../images/Week1/inference.png")

```

## What will be in this course?

- Not a ton of calculations, but a lot of interpreting, reading, and writing.
- We will work with *R* code and output. If programming is new and hard to you, focus on the statistical concepts first!
- The labs and homework will be provided in both *R* file and PDF. Feel free to print it out and write.
- As a new faculty, I am learning and I am open to feedback

## What is R?

+ An open-source, free software environment
+ System for statistical computation and graphics
+ CRAN is *R*'s central software repository
  - Contains contributed packages

**It is OK if you never use it (or even heard about it) before! This is not a prerequisite for this course.**

## Installing R

1. Download and run the R installer for your operating system from CRAN
  - Windows: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/
  - Mac: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/
  - Linux: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/
2. Now download RStudio from the RStudio website – IDE of R
 - https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
3. If you are using a Mac, you may need to download XQuartz.
https://www.xquartz.org/
 - If you run into issues, try downloading this to see if it helps.
