## R Studio Set-Up

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("../images/Week1/rstudio.png")

```

To Create a Script, Click the Following: File -> New File -> R script

[R Studio IDE Cheatsheet](https://ucdavis-bioinformatics-training.github.io/Oct2017-ILRI-Workshop/Cheat_Sheets/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf) $\\$
[More on R Studio Interface](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-tools/03-Rstudio-interface.html)


---

## Giant Calculator!

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 3
c <- 6

```

.pull-left[
```{r}
a+b #Addition
c-a #Subtraction
b*c #Multiplication
```
].pull-right[
```{r}
c/b #Division 
sqrt(4)
2^3
```
]

---

## Giant Calculator!

**Note**: In R, the following will not work!
```{r eval = FALSE}

b(a+c)
```
*R* will assume the "b()" is indicating some function, NOT multiplication as we do in math and stats. 

Thus, you MUST include the multiplication symbol.
```{r}
b*(a+c)
```

[Basics Cheatsheets](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/base-r-cheat-sheet.pdf)

Note: Adding a "#" to your R Script creates a comment so can take notes

---

## Creating Variables

We can create variables using the assignment operator `<-`

```{r}
x <- 5
```

We can then perform any of the functions on the variables:

```{r}
log(x)
```

Rules of Naming Variables:
+ Variables can't start with a number
+ Case-sensitive
+ There are reserved words that *R* won't let you use for variables names
  - for, in, while, if, else, repeat, break, next

---
## Vectors

A variable does not need to be a single value. We can create a **vector** using the `c` function (combine- combines several objects into one)

```{r}
y <- c(1, 5, 3, 2)
```


Operations can then be done element-wise

```{r}
y/2
```

Determining number of objects in a vector

```{r}
length(y)
```

Can also have vectors of characters

```{r}
bulldogs <- c("american", "english", "french")
bulldogs
```

---
## R Packages

- Commonly used *R* functions are installed with base *R*
- *R* packages containing more specialized *R* functions can be installed freely from CRAN servers using the function `install.packages()`
  + Should now show up in *Packages* Tab
- After packages are installed, their function can be loaded into the current *R* session using the function `library()`


---

## Installing Packages

**Note**: To run code from your script:
+ Windows: Ctrl + Enter
+ Mac: Cmd + Enter
+ Highlight what you want to run and hit the “Run” button

We will be installing the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package.

**Method 1**
```{r, eval= FALSE}

install.packages("tidyverse")

#Note: It may take a while (use "#" to create notes in R)
```

**Method 2** - Point and Click

+ Tools -> Install Packages

Only have to do this once!!

---
## Load Package

Let's load the package we just installed!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Will have to run this every time we are in a new session and want to use this package

---

## Load Data

We usually work with .csv file in R. When you have a file that need to be read into the Rstudio, first put it with the R markdown file, or set the working directory to the file. 

First Check your working directory!

Method 1:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
getwd() #What is your working directory
setwd() # Change Working directory

```

Method 2 (recommendation):

Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory -> Select folder data set is located -> Apply

---
## Load Data

Second, then load in the data
```{r, linewidth=80}
data = read.csv("data/ICUAdmissions.csv")
head(data) #make sure data loads in correctly

```

Should see data in environment panel (upper right)

---

## Help


```{r eval = FALSE}
?head
```

This returns the help documentation for this function

Googling for help can be difficult at first. You might need to search for R + CRAN +  to get good results

Stackoverflow is VERY helpful!

[R Reference Card](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf)

## Some Basic Functions

Check variable types

```{r}
str(data)

```

<br>
Note: The purpose of checking variable types is to make sure R is understanding what each column is representing.

---

## Some Basic Functions

Sex and Race is being read as an "int" type variable, meaning as an integer.

We actually want to treat this variable as a factor!

```{r}

#To change this column to a factor:
data$Sex <- as.factor(data$Sex)
data$Race <- as.factor(data$Race)


#Now they are factors!
class(data$Sex)
class(data$Race)

```

---

## Some Basic Functions

Selecting Specific Row/Column

```{r}
data[1,] #first row
data[1:10,3] #third column, rows 1 - 10 
data$Age[1:10] #also third column, rows 1 - 10  
data[1,3] #first observation in third column

```



---

## Some Basic Functions

If we want a summary of the data

```{r}
summary(data[1:5])
```

---
## Some Notes: Warnings vs Errors

+ Routinely beginners to R panic if they see a red message as innocuous as confirming that a library loaded
  - Not all red text means that there is an error!

+ A *warning* is a message that does not disturb the program flow but is displayed along with the output

  - Not always a cause for concern

+ An *error* will terminate a program from being ran

+ Google is your Friend!
  - As an open source software, there is a TON of help out there!

## Next: Brief Introduction to R Markdown

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

One method for completing labs/homework

Helpful Links:
+ [Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
+ [Installation Help](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html)

```{r eval = FALSE}
#This alone creates html/word documents
install.packages("rmarkdown") #install the knitr package

```


```{r eval= FALSE}
#If you want to create a PDF need Latex
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX
```
