### Random Variables


- Last week, we talked about the probability of an event.    
  + **Example**: let `C` be the event that a person is diagnosed with Cancer, we have `P(C)`.
- Now suppose we have three people, and we are wondering what is the probability that exactly one of them is diagnosed with Cancer.
  + You can either calculate the sum of all possible events, or use a random variable

A **random variable** is a **function** that maps each event in a sample space to a number.
  +  Let random variable X be the number of people diagnosed with Cancer, then the question is asking what is P(X = 1)?

### Random Variables

Let's consider a more familiar random phenomenon: a coin flip

If a coin is tossed three times, the outcome is a sequence of observed heads and tails

&lt;img src="../images/Week5/randon-variable-heads.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The figure shows all the possible outcomes when a coin is tossed three times. 
`\(\\\)`
Here, the random variable `\(X\)` is the number of heads for the three tosses.

---
### Probability Distribution

Probability distribution: a list of the probabilities of all mutually exclusive outcomes of random variable

We can assign probabilities to values of a random variable. Let's calculate these probabilities:

---
### Probability Distribution

We can use bar graphs to display the distribution of a random variable

&lt;img src="../images/Week5/probability-distribution-heads.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Rules:

+ Outcomes must be mutually exclusive
+ Each probability must be between 0 and 1
+ Probabilities must sum to 1
---
### Probability Distribution

Based on the potential outcomes of a random variable, we can classify random variables and their distribution into continuous and discrete. e.g., 
  + The number of people enter the clinic 
  + The proportion of people recovered with the new drug
  
For discrete random variable, its probability distribution is called probability mass function (p(y))

For continuous random variable, its probability distribution is called probability density function (f (y))



---
### Example: Let's Start with an Example

The forced expiratory volume (FEV, measured in liters) is a primary indicator of successful lung function and corresponds to the volume of air that can be forcibly be blown out in the first second after fully breathing in. A study of FEV on a sample of n = 654 children measured the children’s age, FEV, height, sex, and whether they had been exposed to second-hand smoke.
&lt;br&gt;
Let’s see the distribution of FEV and height.

### Normal Distribution

**Normal Distribution**: the probability distribution that generates a perfect “bell-shaped curve”
  - A continuous probability distribution (any value in an interval is possible) 
  - Two parameters: mean `\((\mu)\)` and standard deviation `\((\sigma)\)`.
    + Notation: `\(N(\mu, \sigma)\)` 


&lt;img src="Week5-Notes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
### Properties of the Normal Model

- Symmetric and unimodal about the mean `\(\mu\)`
- Probability distribution is highest at exactly `\(\mu\)`
- The standard deviation `\(\sigma\)` controls the spread the distribution

&lt;img src="../images/Week5/normal-dist.png" width="1501" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
### Relationship between Density and Probability

- Density is not probability
- The area under the probability density function is 1
  - Probability is measured by the area under the curve. e.g., the shaded area in the figure represents the P(−2 &lt; X &lt; 0)
  - Note: For a continuous variable, at any point x, P(X = x) = 0

&lt;img src="Week5-Notes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
### Finding Normal Probabilities

The probability density function for the normal distribution is:

`$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{−(x−μ)^2/2\sigma^2}$$`

How do we find the area under it?

 + Traditional chart reading with Z score
 + Use R as a calculator
 
 
---
### Z-Score

- Comparing and calculating values across different normal distributions can be tricky.
- One of the solution is to convert all normal distribution with different mean and standard deviation to a standard normal distribution.
- For a random normal distribution, we can always define a new random variable Z, such that `$$Z = \frac{X − \mu}{\sigma},$$` then Z will follow a standard normal distribution with mean equal to 0 and standard deviation equals to 1.


**Essentially**: if `\(X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \text{ then }  Z = \frac{X − \mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0,1)\)` 

  - [Proof](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat414/lesson/16/16.2)

---
### Z-Score

- Quantifies how far the observation is from the mean, in units of standard deviation
- Observations above the man have positive Z-scores, while observations below the mean have negative Z-scores.

&lt;img src="../images/Week5/standard-normal.png" width="70%" height="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
### Standard Normal Distribution

The Standard Normal `\((N(0,1))\)` distribution is well-studied

We have a z-score chart that records all the probabilities of the standard normal distribution from `\(-\infty\)` to a certain value ([link to chart](https://www.z-table.com/)). 

- A normal probability table can be used to identify the percentile corresponding to any particular Zscore.
- `R function`: `xpnorm`
- Online Calculator: https://istats.shinyapps.io/NormalDist/

]

If you want to calculate `\(P( a &lt; X &lt; b)\)`, then $$ P( a &lt; X &lt; b) = P( -\infty &lt; X &lt; b) = P( -\infty &lt; X &lt; a)$$

### Application: FEV

Assume forced expiratory volume (FEV) follows a normal model with `\(\mu\)` = 2.64 and `\(\sigma\)` = 0.87. Find the probability that a child has FEV less than 1.5. First let's calculate the z-score.

### Application: FEV

Assume forced expiratory volume (FEV) follows a normal model with `\(\mu\)` = 2.64 and `\(\sigma\)` = 0.87. Find the probability that a child has FEV less than 1.5.



In the `mosaic` package in R, we have a function called `xpnorm`


``` r
xpnorm(q=1.5, mean = 2.64, sd=0.87)
```

---
### Application: Birth Weights

The babies born in single births in the United States have birth weights that are approximately normally distributed with mean 3.3 kg and standard deviation 0.56 kg. For both questions, calculate the Z-score by hand first.

- What is the probability of a baby with a born weight between 3 kg and 4 kg?
- What is the probability of a baby with a born weight more than 5 kg?

### Your Turn: Spy Height

It was rumored that Britain’s domestic intelligence service MI5 has an upper limit on the height of its spies, on the assumption that tall people stand out. (For the record - they deny this.) The rumor says that, to apply to be a spy, you can be no taller than 5 feet 11 inches (180.3 cm) if you are a man, and no taller than 5 feet 8 inches (172.7 cm) if you are a woman – supposedly to allow the spies to blend in with a crowd. Adult heights are known to be approximately normally distributed. For males, x ∼ N(177.0, 7.1) and for females, x ∼ N(163.3, 6.4).

+ What proportion of British males are eligible to apply to MI5?
+ What proportion of British females are eligible to apply to MI5?

Sketch a graph of both distributions to help you out and calculate Z-score by hand first.

### Empirical Rule

A simple rule for working with the normal model is the Empirical Rule:

- Approximately 68% of all probability in a normal model is within `\(\mu \pm \sigma\)`
- Approximately 95% of all probability in a normal model is within `\(\mu \pm 2\sigma\)`
- Approximately 99.7% of all probability in a normal model is within `\(\mu \pm 3\sigma\)`

&lt;img src="../images/Week5/empirical rule.png" width="1605" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
### Application: Birth Rate

The babies born in singleton births in the United States have birth weights that are approximately normally distributed with mean 3.296 kg and standard deviation 0.560 kg.

+ Give a range for the central 68% of all birth weights.
+ Give a range for the central 95% of all birth weights.
+ Give a range for nearly all birth weights (99.7%).

### Does the data ”fit” a normal model?

The normal distribution can be used to approximate other distributions, such as the binomial distribution. In order to continue with using the normal distribution, we must test the appropriateness of this assumption

+ **QQ plot**: a quantile-quantile plot plots the sample values from our data against the corresponding ”theoretical quantiles” from a normal distribution using converted z-scores
+ The closer the QQ plot is to a straight line, the better our data ”fits” a normal model.
+ No QQ plot will be exactly perfect. Look for obvious deviations!
